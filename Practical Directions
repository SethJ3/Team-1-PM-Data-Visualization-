Team project - Each team will find 10 years' worth of historical atmospheric data (weather) for Sandusky, Ohio, for 5 days in July, starting with July 18 and ending July 22.

The data needs to include, but is not limited to, Temperature, Humidity, average wind speed and Direction, and precipitation (rain).
Also, see if there is any historical data of Severe weather during these dates.

Using your new Data Visualization skill, determine if there are any patterns in the weather and show them to me visually. You will be presenting this to me and the class.

Come up with a prediction of the weather for July 20 based on your data.

I will give your team extra credit if you can find the water temperature for the last 10 years and can show that in a graph.
